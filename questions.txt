-should I prevent bad input in my functions?
--like in the flip tiles field, where the user enters numbers.  SHould i prevent negatives, strings, or null?
-Should I validate user's emails? How do I do that?

-Is turn too large?

-Should I create a separate function for all error strings, and string messages that get shown to players?

-What are some good places to incorporate memcaching and task queues/cron jobs?

-does my init file structure look sound?

-do my Enums in models look ok?  It's sort of weird that in the API Explorer a user will have to type "ADDITION" for dice_operation and "NINE" for number_of_dice.  I'd really prefer it if users could select from a drop-down list or type the number out.


-is the way that I split the utility function in utils and have the class functions in models okay?
