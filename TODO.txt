TODO
--Enable players to play with unlimited tiles.
--Create some sort of algorithm that decides when to decrement the amount of dice when there are many tiles, for good gameplay
--Google App Engine GET vs POST.  It seems if I change the http_method in the @endpoints.method to GET, the API isn't allowed to receive any parameters.  So does that mean that for methods that are simply querying the datastore for information, andnot actually storing/posting any data, they still need to be POSTS?
--Think about use of enums, is there a better data model?
--Could I add to __init__.py to make less imports?
--Is main.turn too large? split it up in different files/functions that have more clear tasks
--Is my error handling consistent?
